# TicTacToe Game in Python

## How It Works
1. The game sets up the board with numbers 1–9 so players know which positions are available.
2. The current board is displayed in a 3x3 format, showing moves already made.
3. The game checks if the board is full to detect a draw before continuing.
4. Players can choose their markers (X or O) before the game begins.
5. The game validates each move, ensuring it’s a number from 1–9 and that the position isn’t already taken.
6. After each move, the board is updated and displayed immediately.
7. The game detects winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals) and declares the winner.
8. If no winner is found and the board is full, it declares a draw.
9. After the game ends, players can choose to play again without restarting the program.
